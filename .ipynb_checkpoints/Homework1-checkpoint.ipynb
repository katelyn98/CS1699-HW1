    "##### There are many different ways to measure fairness in AI. As such, there are many ways to adjust your AI models so that they better fit these fairness metrics. Here, you will examine this firsthand with the COMPAS dataset, which is a dataset that has been widely used to predict inmates' likelihood of recidivism (reoffense). First, you will run a simple classifier on this dataset and examine the results. Then, you will be asked how this classifier could be made more fair and, for extra credit, you can try implementing these changes yourself.\n"

This highlights our first imbalance in the dataset. Specifically, there are 3175 observations for African-American offenders while there is only 2103 observations for Caucasian offenders. There are less than 1000 offenders for the other four categories combined. Given that there are 6172 total observations in the COMPAS dataset, African Americans make up more than 50% of the observations while Caucasians only make up 34% of the observations. \n",

    "In terms of age, the distribution is skewed right meaning that the mean of the age from this dataset will be higher than the mode which can be misleading. Here, the mode of age from our dataset is 24 while the mean is 34.5 and the median is 31. For the most part, the observations in the COMPAS dataset capture offenders primarily between the age of 21 and 40 with sparse representation for those over the age of 60 and under the age of 21. \n",

Thus approximately 32% of Caucasian offenders were predicted to have a high likelihood of reoffending and 49% of African American offenders were predicted to have a high likelihood of reoffending. \n",

    "These trends can be seen in the visualization showing the relationship between the decile score and Caucasian offenders - again a skewed right distribution where a majority of the Caucasian offenders received a decile score of 5 or less. The visualization showing the relationship between the decile score and the African American offenders shows a uniform distribution. ***For this dataset to be fair, it should have be set up such that the decile score for Caucasian offenders also had a uniform distribution.*** The relationship between the decile score and gender is fairly similar for males and females. However, it would still be beneficial for these to have a uniform distribution. \n",

This is slightly above the predicted 49% from the predicted decile scores of 6 or greater. Out of the 2103 observations for Caucasian offenders, 822 (39%) reoffended within two years of release. The ground truth reveals that 7% more Caucasian reoffended within two years of release than the decile scores predicated. The error rate for the Caucasian class is significantly larger than the error rate for the African American class. However, we will see more details about the error rates in the next section."

For all of the other thresholds, the false positive rate was much higher for the African Americans than Caucasians. This is showing that more African Americans were wrongly predicted to reoffend than Caucasians were. For the the threshold of 2 for exmaple, African American with a decile score of 2 or above would be predicted to reoffend when 82% of those African American offenders in fact did not reoffend. Conversely, for all of the Caucasian offenders with a decile score of 2 or higher, only 62% of them did not reoffend.

First thing it is showing is that the score is bias towards Caucasian by wrongly predicting that they will not reoffend when in fact they do. Second it is showing that fewer African Americans reoffended than Caucasians when they were predicted that they would not reoffend. More specifically, the false negative rate, or miss rate, for Caucasians at the threshold of 9 was 89%. So 89% were predicted to not reoffend, but in fact did reoffend. Wow! For African Americans, 75% were predicted to not offend, but in fact did reoffend. Looking at the decile score of 6, 61% of Caucasians were predicted to not reoffend, but in fact did while only 38% of African Americans were predicted to not reoffend, but did."

    "In the confusion matrix for African Americans, more African Americans were predicted to not recidivate than recidivate. This confusion matrix shows that it wrongly predicted that an African American would not reoffend, but in fact did. It was predicted that 2330 African Americans out of the 3175 would not reoffend, however 1027 did reoffend.  In total, it predicted that 73% of the offenders would not reoffend and it predicted correctly for 56% of those offenders. Another note to add was that it predicted 73% would not reoffend and the ground truth shows that only 48% did not reoffend. It was predicted that 845 African Americans out of the 3175 would reoffend and 634 of those 845 did. In total, it predicted that 27% of the offenders would reoffend and 75% of them did. The ground truth shows that 52% did reoffend. The precision for this confusion matrix is 65.48% and the recall is 62.12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the confusion matrix for the Caucasians, it seems to have over estimated the number of offenders who would not reoffend but in fact did. In total, it predicted that 89% of the Caucasian offenders would not reoffend and 35% of those offenders did actually reoffend. The ground truth shows that only 61% did not reoffend. In terms of Caucasian offenders would reoffend, it predicted that 11% would reoffend and in fact, 73% did reoffend. The ground truth shows that 40% did reoffend. The precision for this confusion matrix is 68.77% and the recall is 57.47%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrices for both African Americans and Caucasians were off when predicting the correct amount of offenders who would reoffend and who would not reoffend. However, the precision was better for confusion matrix for Caucasian offenders. The recall was better for the confusion matrix for African American offenders. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of gender, the confusion matrices were still biased towards predicting that an individual would not reoffend. The precision was nearly the same for both of them with the females at 67.07% and males at 67.15%. The recall was slightly worse for the females at 58.39% and 60.94% for the males. \n",

    "The African American confusion matrix for the SVM classifier was more biased towards predicting that and offender would reoffend, however the precision was 65.28% which is 0.2% worse than the other confusion matrix. Running through totals again to compare to the COMPAS dataset confusion matrix: For the African American offenders, in total, it predicted 395 out of the 966 African American offenders would not recidivate (41%). Out of the entire test set, that is 395 out of 1583 or 25%. 141 of those 387 (36%) did in fact recidivate. However, ground truth shows that 456 out of the 966 (47%) African American offenders and out of the total 1584 (29%) offenders did not recidivate. It predicted that 571 out of the 966 (59%) African American offenders and out of the total 1584 (36%) offenders would recidivate. 369 of those 571 (65%) did in fact recidivate. Ground truth shows that 510 out of the 966 (53%) African American offenders and out of the total 1584 (32%) offenders did recidivate. Here, for African American offenders, it is bias towards predicting that they will recidivate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the SVM confusion matrix for Caucasian offenders, the precision was 63.33% which is lower than the COMPAS confusion matrix and the recall was 62.78% which is higher than the COMPAS confusion matrix. Overall, this confusion matrix was slightly more biased towards predicting that a Caucasian offender would not recidivate when they actually did. Looking at the numbers, there are a total of 618 Caucasian offenders in the test set. Out of those 618, 400 were predicted to not recidivate which is 65%. Take note this is much higher than the 41% that was predicted for African American offenders. 119 (30%) of those 400 did in fact recidivate. This aligns similar to the 36% of African Americans who also did recidivate. Conversely, out of the 618, 218 (35%) were predicted to recidivate which is much lower than the 59% of African American offenders who were predicted to recidivate. 123 out of the 218 (56%) in fact did recidivate which is slightly less accurate than the African Americans confusion matrix. Ground truth shows that 242 out of the 618 (40%) and out of the total 1584 (15%) did in fact recidivate. There is clearly significantly less data in the test set for Caucasian offenders than African American offenders. \n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to gender, 179 out of 284 (63%) females were predicted to not recidivate, however 50 out of those 179 (28%) did. It was about 50% accurate on its recidivate prediction for females. However for males, it predicted that 684 out of the 1300 males would recidivate and only 65% did. However, there was a significantly larger sample for males than females which introduces biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy of the SVM on testing set 64.84% which is about 1% better than COMPAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both showed biases towards predicting more African Americans to reoffend and less Caucasians to reoffend."

    "I think the dataset being used on the classifier needs to be modified to have a uniform distribution of observations for decile scores of Caucasians similar to how there is currently a uniform distribution for the decile scores for African Americans. I think the representation of observations that are predicted to be recidivism and not recidivism should be equal in the training set, as well. Another thing that could be beneficial is if protected attributes are removed from the dataset all together so it is not learned to be correlated with one predicition over another (i.e avoid the model from having disparate impact). We could also have the model satisfy equalized odds by ensuring the true positive rate and the false positive rate of a protected group and a regular group are equal. I am going to try implementing disparate impact remover and then run the SVM classifier again. "
